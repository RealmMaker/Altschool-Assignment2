        <blockquote><p>I am many things; a vivid day dreamer more so than the others. But more often than not life bears its storms, and the murky triumvirate of fear, doubt and precariousness shroud these magnificent castles I so fondly erect in the sky. All the same, they say cast your face to the Sun and shadows will fall behind you. So here is handy piece of sunshine for those gloomy days, neatly captured in a song:</p>

<p>I've dreamed many dreams that never came true.
I've seen them vanish at dawn.
But I've realized enough of my dreams, thank God,
To make me want to dream on.</p>

<p>I've prayed many prayers, when no answers came,
Though I waited patient and long,
But answers came to enough of my prayers
To make me keep praying on.</p>

<p>I've trusted many a friend that failed
And left me to weep alone,
But I've found enough of my friends true blue
To make me keep trusting on.</p>

<p>I've sown many seeds that fell by the way
For the birds to feed upon,
But I have held enough golden sheaves in my hands
To make me keep sowing on.</p>

<p>I've drained the cup of disappointment and pain
And gone many days without song,
But I've sipped enough nectar from the roses of life
To make me want to live on.</p></blockquote>
